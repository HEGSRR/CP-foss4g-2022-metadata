# The foundation for open geographic information science will be geospatial metadata

Free and open source software for geospatial analysis supports burgeoning possibilities for practicing open and computationally reproducible human-environment and geographical research (Singleton et al 2016), for example in cyberGIS communities for open geospatial science.
Open and reproducible research practices may accelerate the pace of scientific discovery and enhance the scientific community's functions of knowledge verification, correction, and diffusion (Rey 2009, Kedron and Holler 2022).
Metadata provides the foundation for open and reproducible research and scientific data management, but there is an urgent need to develop user-friendly open source metadata management tools for research with open source geospatial software.
In this three-part paper, I first review literature on open and reproducible science to substantiate the key functions and requirements of geospatial metadata from proposal development and pre-analysis registration through publishing, archiving, and reproducing published research.
I then review existing metadata standards and popular open source platforms for geospatial research and their support for the requirements of geospatial metadata articulated in the literature review.
Finally, I articulate a vision for open source geospatial metadata software development in support of open and reproducible human-environment and geographical research.
This vision is based on the literature and software reviews, lessons learned from formally reproducing published studies in the geographic sciences with open source software, and teaching open reproducible geographic information science to undergraduate and graduate geography students.
This research is relevant to FOSS4G contributors interested in enhancing the utility and uptake of open source geospatial software in the research community, to geospatial scientists working on enhancing the reproducibility of their own work, and to geospatial research funding agencies and data archives interested in developing open and reproducible science practices.

## Open and reproducible science

Following Wilson et al's (2021) five star guide for reproducibility, researchers can achieve four-star status by conducting research with open data and software and documenting metadata according to the standards of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium).
For Tullis and Kar (2021), metadata is the key to documenting the provenance of research data artifacts, preserving information about every detail of data creation and transformation.
Wilkinson et al's (2016) FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management enumerate functions for metadata in each of the principles for research: findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.
Each principle is supported by metadata encoded with machine- and human-readable standards.

### Research Design

Most research projects involving human subjects must register a research protocol with an Institutional Review Board (IRB) or Research Ethics Committee for assessment of ethical treatment and protection of the interests of research subjects.

### Research Practice

### Research Publishing and Archiving

## ISO Standards

The ISO standards for geospatial metadata contain information about metadata authorship, data authorship, spatial and temporal extent, coordinate systems, data format, spatial resolution, data dictionaries for attributes, licenses, and access protocols.

## FOSS4G Software

The FOSS4G software ecosystem includes desktop GIS (e.g. QGIS, GRASS, SAGA, gvSIG), web and catalog services (e.g. GeoNetwork and GeoNode)

The XXX component of geospatial metadata should clearly explain accessibility protocols.
Researchers are often constrained from sharing their data due to proprietary licenses or confidentiality.
In such cases, data may be treated for with techniques such as simulation, sampling, or randomization.
This data requires  
Thoroughly documented metadata must stand in for data that cannot be shared by researchers due to constraints of proprietary or confidential licenses, conveying enough information about inaccessible data for other researchers to design replication studies testing the original findings with new data.

## Vision

Geospatial metadata software should support all steps of the research process from initial research design through to publishing and archiving.
At the research design phase, software should support researchers by integrating metadata into their research proposal data management plans, institutional review board research protocols,
human subjects protocols
