Other comments: The text presents a method for the documentation of metadata for the reproducibility of research in the area of geographic information. It is part of a very well structured project, is nicely documented in the git platform and cites recent and relevant references. There is a clear contribution in the repository containing examples of reproduction of spatial analysis and in the review of metadata handling by open source tools. The topic of open science and geospatial data management is very relevant and the contribution is quite significant to the FOSS4G community. Only through the summary, it is not very clear how the documents are structured, this information can only be obtained by observing git. One suggestion would be to better summarize the introduction so that there is more space to make clearer to the reader the structure of the proposal for a simplified understanding of the results.
